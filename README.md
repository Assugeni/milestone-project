## The 1975 Website
My project focuses on the popular rock band, The 1975. This website is for fans of theirs who like to keep up with their tour dates, latest music and easy access to their social medias. The website also caters to companies and venues who would like to see where they are touring and possibly book them. 

My project has its opening page where it briefly describes the bands history and what they are all about, while also showing the members of the band. This is crucial as visually seeing who you will be engaging with is very important and brings it to a personal level. The second menu item brings fans and potential bookers to the touring timeline of the 1975, which enables them to see when and where the band will be playing for the foreseeable future. I have also enabled a feature to allow fans to be directed to the ticket selling websites for each arena so they can purchase tickets to see the band live. The following menu item allows for individuals to listen to some of the bands popular hits and see photos of them live in action. The last menu item allows for companies and venues to contact the band for bookings and shows. It also has a section for fans, allowing them to have easy access to the bands verified username on their social medias and subsequently, links to the bands direct social media pages.
